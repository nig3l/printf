.B #include \(dqmain.h\(dq

.B int _printf(const char *

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf is a variadic function that produces a string according to a specified format
and prints it to the standard output, much like the C standard library function printf. It can receive a arbitrary number of arguments.

.B Return value
On success, _printf returns the number of characters that are printed. If the format is NULL or if the functions encounters any error, it returns -1.

.B Conversion specifiers
These are the characters that specify the type of the variable that needs to be printed.

.B Format string
The format string can contain any characters, just like a regular string, in double quotes, which will be printed as is.
However, this format string can contain conversion specifiers. These start with a %, and are followed with a character.

The variables to be printed are separated from the format string with a comma. Each variable passed to _printf need to have a conversion specifier.

.B d, i
- These are specifiers are for integer arguments. They convert the variable to a decimal.
.B c
- Prints a character.

.B s
- Prints a string.
